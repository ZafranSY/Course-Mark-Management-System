### **Step 1: Creating the Dockerfile**

1. Open your project directory where your PHP Slim app is located. This will typically be something like:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Create a `Dockerfile` inside your project directory. You can do this with any text editor or directly in the terminal. For example:

   ```bash
   touch Dockerfile
   ```

3. Add the following content to the `Dockerfile` (use the editor of your choice):

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the official PHP 7 Alpine image as a base image
   FROM php:7-alpine

   # Install system dependencies and PHP extensions
   RUN apk --no-cache add \
       bash \
       git \
       libpng-dev \
       libjpeg-dev \
       libfreetype6-dev \
       && docker-php-ext-configure gd --with-freetype --with-jpeg \
       && docker-php-ext-install gd

   # Install Composer (PHP Dependency Manager)
   RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php \
       && mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

   # Set the working directory to /var/www
   WORKDIR /var/www

   # Copy the composer.json and composer.lock (if available) to the container
   COPY composer.json /var/www/

   # Install PHP dependencies using Composer
   RUN composer install

   # Copy the rest of your application code to the container
   COPY . /var/www

   # Expose the port 8080
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Set the command to run the PHP built-in server
   CMD ["php", "-S", "0.0.0.0:8080", "-t", "public"]
   ```

4. **Explanation**:

   * This `Dockerfile` uses a lightweight PHP 7 Alpine image, installs the necessary dependencies, Composer, and copies your app files into the container.
   * It then runs the built-in PHP server on port 8080 and serves your Slim app.

---

### **Step 2: Building the Docker Image**

1. Open the terminal (in the same directory as the `Dockerfile`).

2. Build the Docker image by running:

   ```bash
   docker build -t slim-app:v1 .
   ```

   * `slim-app:v1` is the tag for your image.
   * The `.` at the end indicates that Docker should look for the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

3. Docker will begin downloading the base image, installing dependencies, and setting up the environment according to the `Dockerfile`. This might take a few minutes.

4. Once it's finished, you can confirm the image was created by running:

   ```bash
   docker image ls
   ```

   You should see `slim-app:v1` listed.

---

### **Step 3: Running the Docker Container**

1. Now that the image is built, run the container with the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run --name slim-app-container -p 8080:8080 -d slim-app:v1
   ```

   * `--name slim-app-container`: Names the container `slim-app-container`.
   * `-p 8080:8080`: Maps port `8080` on your machine to port `8080` in the container.
   * `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
   * `slim-app:v1`: The image to run.

2. You can now access your Slim application in the browser by going to `http://localhost:8080`.

3. To confirm the container is running, you can use:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   This will show all running containers.

---

### **Step 4: Stopping the Docker Container**

1. To stop the running container, use:

   ```bash
   docker stop slim-app-container
   ```

   This stops the container.

2. To remove the container after stopping it (optional):

   ```bash
   docker container rm slim-app-container
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Pulling the Docker Image for Your Groupmates**

To make it easier for your groupmates to use the image without building it from scratch, you can upload your Docker image to Docker Hub or another container registry. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Login to Docker Hub (if you don't have an account, create one first)**:

   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

2. **Tag your image for Docker Hub**:

   Tag your image with your Docker Hub username. Replace `yourusername` with your actual Docker Hub username:

   ```bash
   docker tag slim-app:v1 yourusername/slim-app:v1
   ```

3. **Push the image to Docker Hub**:

   After tagging the image, you can push it to Docker Hub:

   ```bash
   docker push yourusername/slim-app:v1
   ```

4. **Now, groupmates can pull the image**:

   To pull the image, your groupmates can run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker pull yourusername/slim-app:v1
   ```

5. Once they have pulled the image, they can run it with the same command:

   ```bash
   docker run --name slim-app-container -p 8080:8080 -d yourusername/slim-app:v1
   ```

### **Step 6: Complete Commands Recap**

Here is a complete summary of the commands you or your groupmates will need:

#### **Create and Build Docker Image**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project          # Navigate to your project directory
touch Dockerfile                  # Create a Dockerfile (if not already created)
# Add content to Dockerfile (as shown earlier)

docker build -t slim-app:v1 .      # Build the Docker image
docker image ls                   # Confirm the image exists
```

#### **Run the Docker Container**

```bash
docker run --name slim-app-container -p 8080:8080 -d slim-app:v1
docker ps                         # Confirm the container is running
```

#### **Stop and Remove the Docker Container**

```bash
docker stop slim-app-container    # Stop the container
docker container rm slim-app-container  # Optionally, remove the container
```

#### **Push the Docker Image to Docker Hub**

```bash
docker login                      # Log in to Docker Hub (if you haven't already)
docker tag slim-app:v1 yourusername/slim-app:v1    # Tag the image for Docker Hub
docker push yourusername/slim-app:v1  # Push the image to Docker Hub
```

#### **Pull and Run the Docker Image**

```bash
docker pull yourusername/slim-app:v1  # Pull the image from Docker Hub
docker run --name slim-app-container -p 8080:8080 -d yourusername/slim-app:v1  # Run the image
```
